1. Write a paper review for "2019 IoT Based eHealth Management System Using Arduino and Google Cloud Firestore.pdf"
Note: Follow the instructions on how to do a paper review.

2. Arduino Programing (WiFiNINA)
Using Arduino IDE write a C program and upload to Arduino Nano 33 IoT board. The program shall 
use the WiFiNINA library to connect with the WiFi. Follow the example programs shown in class

Display in the OLED the following text in each row and update the display at 1sec interval  
See slide 31 of "02 Programming Hands-On Lec06.pdf" for the OLED display requirements
Row 1: Gnnnn WiFiNINA -> where nnnn are last four numbers of your GMU G number: Example G5678
Row 2: WiFi.RSSI() and WiFi.localIP()
Row 3: ""
Row 4: "SSID: " and WiFi.SSID()
Row 5: ""
Row 6: "rM: and MAC address of your wireless router: Use getMacRouter() from "02 Programming Hands-On Lec06.pdf"
Row 7: "wM: and MAC address of your Arduino WiFi Shield: Use getMacWifiShield() from "02 Programming Hands-On Lec06.pdf"
Row 8: "Uptime: " dd hh:mm:ss (where dd is number of days in two digits)
Take a video of your OLED display and board. The video shall show changes of WiFi.RSSI() value

3. ESP32-C3-DevKitM-1 Programing (WiFi) 
Implementing (2) in ESP32-C3 requires some effort
Take a video of your OLED display and board. The video shall show changes of WiFi.RSSI() value

OPTIONAL: 
(a) Measure the time (in seconds) it takes to connect to your WiFi
(b) Update your code so that it reconnects in case WiFi goes down

IMPORTANT:
Your main programming file shall contain the following info commented out. Update the content as necessary
