1. Write "IoT technologies for embedded computing" paper review

Follow the instruction given in the presentation on how to do a review. Read the following IEEE paper on IoT technologies for embedded computing and write a one-page review.
The review should include ~2 paragraphs of paper summary (what is done in the paper and how it is done), following by your thinking on strength and weaknesses of the paper.
The format of your report should be in IEEE double columns, single spaced format with font 10. The title should be formatter as "Review of ....." and in place of the authors name, you should use your name. 
This exercise is to familiarize you with writing IEEE style reports, which is needed for writing the final project report.

2. Arduino Programing of OLED display

Using Arduino IDE write a C program and upload to Arduino Nano 33 IoT board. The program shall 

a. Blink the yellow LED at .5 Hz (1sec On, 1sec Off)
b. Display in the OLED the following text in each ROW and update the display at 1sec interval with new content. You can use the sketch presented during class and modify it.  
   Row 1: ECE508 mm/dd/yyyy -> where mm is month, dd is date in two digits. These are hardcoded values based on the day you wrote the program
   Row 2: Gxxxxnnnn -> where nnnn are last four numbers of your GMU G number: Example Gxxxx5678
   Row 3: Display the milliseconds since the program starts running: Hint use millis() to get the time in milliseconds
   Row 4: hh:mm:ss that shows the time passed since the program starts running: Hint use millis() to get the time in milliseconds and convert to hh:mm:ss
   Row 5: Test 5
   Row 6: Test 6
   Row 7: Test 7
   Row 8: Display Row 3 content
c. Take a picture and a short video of your breakout board and OLED display while your program is running

Your main programming file shall contain the following info commented out. Update the content as necessary 

/**************************************************************************
