    1. Continue work with your Final project

    2. Arduino Programing (FreeRTOS - DHT22, PIR)

    Using Arduino IDE write a C program that uses FreeRTOS_SAMD21 libraries

    The program shall have at least four threads. Thread 'threadPIR' shall have the highest priority
    a. threadPIR (reads PIR digital output valPIR every 500ms)
    b. threadDHT22 (reads temperature and humidity once every two seconds)
    c. threadOLED (update display at 3 sec interval)
    d. taskMonitor (the thread from the FreeRTOS example)

    Display in the OLED the following text in each ROW.  
    Row 1: Gnnnn FreeRTOS -> where nnnn are last four numbers of your GMU G number:
    Row 2: ""
    Row 3: ""
    Row 4: "Temp in C: " temperature
    Row 5: "Humidity in RH%: " humidity
    Row 6: "PIR detection: " valPIR
    Row 7: ""
    Row 8: "Uptime: " dd hh:mm:ss

    IMPORTANT:

    Your main programming file shall contain the following info commented out. Update the content as necessary
    Take a video of your OLED display and Arduino IDE Serial Monitor. The video shall show the taskMonitor output in the Serial Monitor
