hwLec08 - MQTT and Project Proposals (ShiftrIO Desktop)
1. Arduino Nano 33 IoT Programing (MQTT Client)
a. Modify the "nano33iot_ece508_MQTT_ShiftrIO_Desktop" program (or create your own) to connect as MQTT client with Shiftr.io MQTT Broker running in your laptop/desktop
b. Your client ID shall be "client_nnnn_Gxxxxdddd" where nnnn is a random decimal number and dddd the last digits of your G number (e.g. client_1574_Gxxxx1234)
c. Create two topics 
     1. "ece508/Gxxxxdddd/nano33iot/dht22/temp" where dddd the last four digits of your G number
     2. "ece508/Gxxxxdddd/nano33iot/dht22/humid" where dddd the last four digits of your G number
d. Every 3 seconds publish the DHT22 temperature (in F) and humidity reading in Topic 1 and Topic 2 respectively
e. Upload an 10sec video showing the MQTT messages from Arduino Nano 33 IOT in Shiftr.io application and your code folder (zipped) as your assignment
2. Repeat (1) for ESP32-C3-DevKitM-1. For the topics, replace "nano33iot" with "esp32c3"
3. Prepare your Final Project proposal. Each team shall present (~10min)
a. Final Project Use-case description
b. Final Project IoT technical solution
